## 🚀 Website Traffic Prediction  

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts **website traffic conversion rates** using different regression models. We analyze how various factors (page views, session duration, bounce rate, etc.) impact conversion rates and use **Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression** to improve predictions.  

The final model is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive user access.

### 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of multiple website traffic features:  

| Feature Name         | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Page Views**        | Number of pages viewed by a visitor |
| **Session Duration**  | Total time spent on the website |
| **Bounce Rate**       | Percentage of visitors leaving without interaction |
| **Traffic Source**    | Source of traffic (Organic, Paid, Referral, Social) |
| **Time on Page**      | Average time spent on a page |
| **Previous Visits**   | Number of times a user has visited before |
| **Conversion Rate**   | Percentage of visitors who take a desired action |

### 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used  

#### ✅ **1. Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**  
- Uses a single feature (**Page Views**) to predict **Conversion Rate**.  
- **R² Score:** `0.0417` (Poor performance)  

#### ✅ **2. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**  
- Uses multiple features to improve predictions.  
- **R² Score:** `0.1191` (Better but still low)  

#### ✅ **3. Polynomial Regression**  
- Introduces non-linearity to improve the model.  
- **R² Score:** `0.2669` (Best so far, but risk of overfitting)  

#### ✅ **4. Ridge Regression with GridSearchCV**  
- Used to **reduce overfitting** in polynomial regression.  
- **R² Score:** `0.2117` (Slight improvement with better generalization)

### ⚡ Results & Insights  

- **Polynomial Regression performed the best** with an **R² of 0.2669**, but it showed signs of **overfitting**.  
- **Ridge Regression helped in reducing overfitting**, balancing **bias-variance tradeoff**.  
- The dataset **does not fully explain** conversion rate variations, suggesting the need for additional features.
